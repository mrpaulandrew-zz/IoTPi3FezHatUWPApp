# IoTPi3FezHatUWPApp

This is the solution I use for my demo's and talks at SQL Relay/SQL Bits etc. I know a few attendee's have asked for a copy of it now so stuck it on here. Please help yourself.

This is the UWP app that collects the Raspberry Pi 3 sensor values from the FezHat topper board and sends JSON messages up to an Azure IoT Event Hub.

I can't get all the credit for this. The original version of this app came from Amy Nicholson of Microsoft. Here is the base app if you'd prefer it without my purple flavoured hackings! :-)
